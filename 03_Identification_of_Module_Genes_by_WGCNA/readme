This is the third step:
1. expression profile data processing
2. separate samples into low- and high-plasma cells enriched groups
3. filtering data at the gene and sample levels
4. identify the suitable beta-value
5. cluster genes into modules and visualization
6. analysis of the relationship between traits and module
7. export genes in the interested module
