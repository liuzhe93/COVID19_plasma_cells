NOTE 1 [file ions.mdp]:
  With Verlet lists the optimal nstlist is >= 10, with GPUs >= 20. Note
  that with the Verlet scheme, nstlist has no effect on the accuracy of
  your simulation.

Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 1

NOTE 2 [file topol.top, line 112679]:
  System has non-zero total charge: 1.000000
  Total charge should normally be an integer. See
  https://manual.gromacs.org/current/user-guide/floating-point.html
  for discussion on how close it should be to an integer.



Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 386487.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

NOTE 3 [file ions.mdp]:
  You are using a plain Coulomb cut-off, which might produce artifacts.
  You might want to consider using PME electrostatics.
