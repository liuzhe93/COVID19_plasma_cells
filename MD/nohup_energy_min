NOTE 1 [file em.mdp]:
  With Verlet lists the optimal nstlist is >= 10, with GPUs >= 20. Note
  that with the Verlet scheme, nstlist has no effect on the accuracy of
  your simulation.

Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 1
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 386484.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

WARNING 1 [file em.mdp]:
  The largest distance between excluded atoms is 1.697 nm between atom
  10752 and 10754, which is larger than the cut-off distance. This will
  lead to missing long-range corrections in the forces and energies. If you
  expect that minimization will bring such distances within the cut-off,
  you can ignore this warning.
