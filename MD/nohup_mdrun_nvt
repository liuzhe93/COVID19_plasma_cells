Executable:   /mnt/zhangzheng_group/liuz-54/miniconda3/envs/py37/bin.AVX2_256/gmx
Data prefix:  /mnt/zhangzheng_group/liuz-54/miniconda3/envs/py37
Working dir:  /mnt/zhangzheng_group/liuz-54/others/MD/3HTB/KIF11
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -deffnm nvt

Compiled SIMD is AVX2_256, but CPU also supports AVX_512 (see log).
The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx mdrun was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx mdrun with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.

Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 21.3%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 24%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 5.2%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 2.599
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 40.9 %

NOTE: 5.2 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      Dynamic load balancing was automatically disabled, but it might be beneficial to manually turn it on (option -dlb yes.)
      You can also consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.
NOTE: 40.9 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.
