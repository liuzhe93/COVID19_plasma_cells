Initialising inter-atomic distances...

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary. Note, that this functionality may
         be removed in a future GROMACS version. Please, consider
         using another file format for your input.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx solvate uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.

Generating solvent configuration
Will generate new solvent configuration of 8x8x6 boxes
Solvent box contains 204186 atoms in 68062 residues
Removed 17766 solvent atoms due to solvent-solvent overlap
Removed 11073 solvent atoms due to solute-solvent overlap
Sorting configuration
Found 1 molecule type:
    SOL (   3 atoms): 58449 residues
Generated solvent containing 175347 atoms in 58449 residues
Writing generated configuration to solv.gro

Output configuration contains 187280 atoms in 59177 residues
Volume                 :     1904.28 (nm^3)
Density                :      996.94 (g/l)
Number of solvent molecules:  58449   

Processing topology

Back Off! I just backed up topol.top to ./#topol.top.1#

GROMACS reminds you: "Sacrifices must be made" (Otto Lilienthal, dying after having crashed with his glider in 1896)

Adding line for 58449 solvent molecules with resname (SOL) to topology file (topol.top)
