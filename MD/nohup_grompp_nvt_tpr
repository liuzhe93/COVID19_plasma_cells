Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 1
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group Protein_BRD is 29803.77
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group CLA_Water is 350688.25

NOTE 1 [file nvt.mdp]:
  There are 1 non-linear virtual site constructions. Their contribution to
  the energy error is approximated. In most cases this does not affect the
  error significantly.


NOTE 2 [file nvt.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.

The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.562 nm between atom 11906 and 11933

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.294 nm, buffer size 0.094 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.222 nm, buffer size 0.022 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
