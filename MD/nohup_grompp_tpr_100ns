Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 1
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group Protein_BRD is 29803.77
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group CLA_Water is 350688.25

NOTE 1 [file md.mdp]:
  There are 1 non-linear virtual site constructions. Their contribution to
  the energy error is approximated. In most cases this does not affect the
  error significantly.

Last frame         -1 time  100.000   

NOTE 2 [file md.mdp]:
  This run will generate roughly 8985 Mb of data

Cleaning up constraints and constant bonded interactions with virtual sites

The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.554 nm between atom 11906 and 11933

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.295 nm, buffer size 0.095 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.223 nm, buffer size 0.023 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
